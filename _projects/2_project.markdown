TYPHON plans to develop a new modeling language (TyphonML) to support the design of hybrid polystores. Using TyphonML, engineers will be able to model the data that needs to be persisted in a homogeneous manner, abstracting over the specificities of the underlying technologies. The language will support modelling both open and closed datasets, i.e. datasets, which conform to an open or strict schema respectively.
