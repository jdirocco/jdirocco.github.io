	abstract = {Deciding if an OSS project meets the required standards for adoption is hard, and keeping up-to-date with a rapidly evolving project is even harder. Making decisions about quality and adoption involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions have to be made with detrimental effects. CROSSMINER aims to remedy this by automatically extracting the required knowledge and injecting it into the developers’ Integrated Development Environments (IDE), at the time they need it to make design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online IDE monitoring. Developers will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced offline deep analyses of related OSS projects.},

abstract="MDE projects may use various MDE technologies (e.g., for model transformation, model comparison, or model/code generation) and thus, contain various MDE artifacts (such as models, metamodels, and model transformations). The details of using the MDE technologies and the relationships between the MDE artifacts are typically not accessible at a higher level of abstraction, which makes it hard to understand, build, and test the MDE projects and thus, to reuse the contained MDE artifacts. In this paper, we present a megamodel-based reverse engineering methodology and an infrastructure MDEprofiler for recovering details of using MDE technologies in MDE projects and modeling these details at a higher level of abstraction. We exemplify the approach for MDE projects that use ATL-based model transformations.",

	abstract = {Open source software (OSS) allows developers to study, change, and improve the code free of charge. There are several high-quality software projects which deliver stable and well-documented products. Most OSS forges typically sustain active user and expert communities which in turn provide decent levels of support both with respect to answering user questions as well as to repairing reported software bugs. Code reuse is an intrinsic feature of OSS, and developing a new system by leveraging existing open source components can reduce development effort, and thus it can be beneficial to at least two phases of the software life cycle, i.e., implementation and maintenance. However, to improve software quality, it is essential to develop a system by learning from well-defined, mature projects. In this sense, the ability to find similar projects that facilitate the undergoing development activities is of high importance. In this paper, we address the issue of mining open source software repositories to detect similar projects, which can be eventually reused by developers. We propose CrossSim as a novel approach to model the OSS ecosystem and to compute similarities among software projects. An evaluation on a dataset collected from GitHub shows that our proposed approach outperforms three well-established baselines.},
