    <p>Conventional wisdom on Model-Driven Engineering suggests that metamodels are crucial elements for modeling environments consisting of graphical editors, transformations, code generators, and analysis tools. Software repositories are commonly used in practice for locating existing artifacts provided that a classification procedure is available. However, the manual classification of metamodel in repositories produces results that are influenced by the subjectivity of human perception besides being tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, automated techniques for classifying metamodels stored in repositories are highly desirable and stringent. In this work, we propose memoCNN as a novel approach to classification of metamodels. In particular, we consider metamodels as data points and classify them using supervised learning techniques. A convolutional neural network has been built to learn from labeled data, and use the trained weights to group unlabeled metamodels. A comprehensive experimental evaluation proves that the proposal effectively categorizes input data and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.</p>

    <p>Open source software (OSS) allows developers to study, change, and improve the code free of charge. There are several high-quality software projects which deliver stable and well-documented products. Most OSS forges typically sustain active user and expert communities which in turn provide decent levels of support both with respect to answering user questions as well as to repairing reported software bugs. Code reuse is an intrinsic feature of OSS, and developing a new system by leveraging existing open source components can reduce development effort, and thus it can be beneficial to at least two phases of the software life cycle, i.e., implementation and maintenance. However, to improve software quality, it is essential to develop a system by learning from well-defined, mature projects. In this sense, the ability to find similar projects that facilitate the undergoing development activities is of high importance. In this paper, we address the issue of mining open source software repositories to detect similar projects, which can be eventually reused by developers. We propose CrossSim as a novel approach to model the OSS ecosystem and to compute similarities among software projects. An evaluation on a dataset collected from GitHub shows that our proposed approach outperforms three well-established baselines.</p>

    <p>Background
Research on empirical software engineering has increasingly been conducted by analysing and measuring vast amounts of software systems. Hundreds, thousands and even millions of systems have been (and are) considered by researchers, and often within the same study, in order to test theories, demonstrate approaches or run prediction models. A much less investigated aspect is whether the collected metrics might be context-specific, or whether systems should be better analysed in clusters.
Objective
The objectives of this study are (i) to define a set of clustering techniques that might be used to group similar software systems, and (ii) to evaluate whether a suite of well-known object-oriented metrics is context-specific, and its values differ along the defined clusters.
Method
We group software systems based on three different clustering techniques, and we collect the values of the metrics suite in each cluster. We then test whether clusters are statistically different between each other, using the Kolgomorov-Smirnov (KS) hypothesis testing.
Results
Our results show that, for two of the used techniques, the KS null hypothesis (e.g., the clusters come from the same population) is rejected for most of the metrics chosen: the clusters that we extracted, based on application domains, show statistically different structural properties.
Conclusions
The implications for researchers can be profound: metrics and their interpretation might be more sensitive to context than acknowledged so far, and application domains represent a promising filter to cluster similar systems.</p>

    <p>Background: In the context of software development, GitHub has been at the forefront of platforms to store, analyze and maintain a large number of software repositories. Topics have been introduced by GitHub as an effective method to annotate stored repositories. However, labeling GitHub repositories should be carefully conducted to avoid adverse effects on project popularity and reachability. Aims: We present TopFilter, a novel approach to assist open source software developers in selecting suitable topics for GitHub repositories being created. Method: We built a project-topic matrix and applied a syntactic-based similarity function to recommend missing topics by representing repositories and related topics in a graph. The ten-fold cross-validation methodology has been used to assess the performance of TopFilter by considering different metrics, i.e., success rate, precision, recall, and catalog coverage. Result: The results show that TopFilter recommends good topics depending on different factors, i.e., collaborative filtering settings, considered datasets, and pre-processing activities. Moreover, TopFilter can be combined with a state-of-the-art topic recommender system (i.e., MNB network) to improve the overall prediction performance. Conclusion: Our results confirm that collaborative filtering techniques can successfully be used to provide relevant topics for GitHub repositories. Moreover, TopFilter can gain a significant boost in prediction performances by employing the outcomes obtained by the MNB network as its initial set of topics.</p>

    <p>Designing and deploying a hybrid data persistence architecture that involves a combination of relational and NoSQL databases is a complex, technically challenging, and error-prone task. In this tool paper, we propose TyphonML, a modeling language and supporting environment, which permits modelers to specify data that need to be persisted in hybrid architectures, by abstracting over the specificities of the underlying technologies. The language enables the specification of both conceptual entities and available data layer technologies, and then how the modeled entities have to be mapped to the available database systems. TyphonML models are used to generate microservice-based infrastructures, which permit users to interact with the designed hybrid polystores at the conceptual level. In this tool paper, we show the different components of the TyphonML environment at work through a demonstration scenario.</p>

    <p>IoT-technologies allow for the connection of miscellaneous devices, thereby creating a platform that sustains rich data sources. Given the circumstances, it is essential to have decent machinery in order to exploit the existing infrastructure and provide users with personalized services. Among others, recommender systems have been widely used to suggest users additional items that best match their needs and expectation. The use of recommender systems has gained considerable momentum in recent years. Nevertheless, the selection of a proper recommendation technique depends much on the input data as well as the domain of applications. In this work, we present an evaluation of two well-known collaborative-filtering (CF) techniques to build an information system for managing and recommending books in the IoT context. To validate the performance, we conduct a series of experiments on two considerably large datasets. The experimental results lead us to some interesting conclusions. In contrast to many existing studies which state that the item-based CF technique outperforms the user-based CF technique, we found out that there is no distinct winner between them. Furthermore, we confirm that the performance of a CF recommender system may be good with regards to some quality metrics, but not to some others.</p>

    <p>MDE projects may use various MDE technologies (e.g., for model transformation, model comparison, or model/code generation) and thus, contain various MDE artifacts (such as models, metamodels, and model transformations). The details of using the MDE technologies and the relationships between the MDE artifacts are typically not accessible at a higher level of abstraction, which makes it hard to understand, build, and test the MDE projects and thus, to reuse the contained MDE artifacts. In this paper, we present a megamodel-based reverse engineering methodology and an infrastructure MDEprofiler for recovering details of using MDE technologies in MDE projects and modeling these details at a higher level of abstraction. We exemplify the approach for MDE projects that use ATL-based model transformations.</p>

    <p>Deciding if an OSS project meets the required standards for adoption is hard, and keeping up-to-date with a rapidly evolving project is even harder. Making decisions about quality and adoption involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions have to be made with detrimental effects. CROSSMINER aims to remedy this by automatically extracting the required knowledge and injecting it into the developers’ Integrated Development Environments (IDE), at the time they need it to make design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online IDE monitoring. Developers will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced offline deep analyses of related OSS projects.</p>

    <p>Over the last years, several model repositories have been proposed in response to the need of the MDE community for advanced systems supporting the reuse of modeling artifacts. Modelers can interact with MDE repositories with different intents ranging from merely repository browsing, to searching specific artifacts satisfying precise requirements. The organization and browsing facilities provided by current repositories is limited since they do not produce structured overviews of the contained artifacts, and the ategorization mechanisms (if any) are based on manual activities. When dealing with large numbers of modeling artifacts, such limitations increase the effort for managing and reusing artifacts stored in model repositories. By focusing on metamodel repositories, in this paper we propose the application of clustering techniques to automatically organize stored metamodels and to provide users with overviews of the application domains covered by the available metamodels. The approach has been implemented in the MDEForge repository.</p>

    <p>In the last years, the increasing complexity of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools and techniques has led to higher demands in terms of computation, interoperability, and configuration management. Harnessing the software-as-a-service (SaaS) paradigm and shifting applications from local, mono-core implementations to cloud-based architectures is key to enhance scalability and flexibility. To this end, we propose MDEForge: an extensible, collaborative modeling platform that provides remote model management facilities and prevents the user from focussing on time-consuming, and less creative procedures. This demo paper illustrates the extensibility of MDEForge by integrating ATL services for the remote execution, automated testing, and static analysis of ATL transformations. The usefulness of their employment under the SaaS paradigm is demonstrated with a case-study showing a wide range of new application possibilities.</p>
